# 2.5 - Putting It Together

## Identity

- no identity requirement, any user can create a key-pair
- to pay someone, you will need their address

## P2P Network

- goal is to broadcast all the transactions

## Confirmations

- more confirmations means more blocks extend your transactions

## Consensus

- ownership of coins is determined by consensus of the system

## Bootstrapping

security of the blockchain requires a healthy mining system
healthy mining system depends on economic value of the coin
value of the coin then depends on security of the blockchain

## What can a 51% attack do?

- Steal coin from existing address?
  No, has to subvert the entire chain.
  Attacker can inject an invalid transaction and keep building this block. Succeeds in making it the longest branch. Honest nodes will continue ignoring this invalid block,
  But the attacker also has to steal the signature, to steal the coins.

- Suppress some transactions?
  Attacker refuses to create blocks from certain addresses, and refuse to build upon blocks that contain these transactions.
  But transactions will still reach a majority of the nodes.

- Change the block reward?
  Change reward to 100 bitcoin? Attackers can't do this, because the attacker doesn't own the software running on the honest nodes.

- Destroy confidence in Bitcoin?
  Very likely.
