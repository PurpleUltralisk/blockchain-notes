# 2.2 - Distributed Concensus

Key technical challenge of decentralized currency = distributed concensus.

Distributed concensus definition:

- all correct nodes decided on the same value
- value must have been proposed by some correct node

Bitcoin
When Alice pays Bob, she broadcasts the transaction to all Bitcoin nodes.
Transaction is going to have Alice's signature.
Transaction also has Bob's public key, where he receives the bitcoin.
Hash pointer to previous transaction.

**Note** Bob doesn't have to be involved for him to receive the funds.

## How concensus could work

- all nodes have a sequence of blocks of transactions they've reached concensus on
- each node has a set of outstanding transactions it's heard about
  A transaction is proposed by a node, and it gets added to the next block.
  Other transactions waits to get processed.

## Why Concensus is Hard

- Nodes may crash
- Nodes may be malicious

- Network is imperfect
- Not all pairs of nodes are connected

There's no global time, we can't determine which node sent the first message.

**Impossibility Results**

- Byzantine Generals Problem
- Fischer-Lynch-Paterson (deterministic nodes): concensus impossible with a single faulty node

**Well Known Protocols**

- Paxos - never produce inconsistent result, but can get stuck

## Bitcoin Solution

- Introduce incentives
- no specific start/end point for concensus
- concensus happen over time, as time goes on, % of transaction being valid increases
