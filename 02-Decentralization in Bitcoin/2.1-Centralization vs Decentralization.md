# 2.1 - Centralization vs. Decentralization

## Aspects of Decentralization in Bitcoin

1. Who maintains this ledger?
2. Who has authority over which transactions are valid?
3. Who creates new bitcoins?
4. Who determines how the rules of the system change?
5. How do bitcoins acquire exchange value?

Peer-to-peer network: is open to anyone
Mining: is also open to anyone, require capital costs => centralization in mining power
