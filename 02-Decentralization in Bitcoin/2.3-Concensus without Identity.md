# 2.3 - Concensus Without Identity

## Benefits of Identity

- Programming protocols such as doing something with the lowest NodeID
- Security - as nodes are attached to a traceable ID

## Why Bitcoin does not have Identity

- identity is hard in a P2P system
- pseudonymity is a goal of Bitcoin

## Weaker Assumption

Assume we have the ability to pick a random node in the system.
Each round we pick a random node, and this node gets to propose the next block in the chain.
Other nodes implicitly accept/reject this block by

- extending it, or
- ignoring it and extending chain from earlier block
  This achieves implict consensus.

## Consensus Algorithm Simplified

1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block
3. Each round, a random node gets to broadcast its block
4. Other nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid (unspent, valid signatures)
5. Nodes express accetance of the block by including its hash in the next block they create

## Malicious Attacker Example

Steal from Another:

- Cannot steal another person's bitcoin because she cannot forge others' signatures
  Deny service:
- Alice does not record any transactions from Bob's address
- But Bob's block just have to wait until an honest block is processing the transactions
  Double spend:
- Alice already paid Bob
- Assuming Alice's node gets to propose the next transaction, Alice use the same coin to pay to another person, ignoring the transaction where she paid Bob.
- Bob can wait for some node to confirm they have received this block before giving Alice the product
- More confirmations = more probability to secure the transaction
  Usually should wait for 6 confirmations.
