# 4.3 - Splitting and Sharing Keys

Goal of splitting keys is to avoid a single point of failure.

## Secret Sharing

Idea: split secret to N pieces, such that given any K pieces, can reconstruct the secret.
But if given fewer than K pieces, can't gain any info on secret.

Example:
N=2, K=2, P=a large prime, S=secret between 0 and P-1 , R = random 0 to P-1
Split pieces into x1 and x2:
x1= (S+R) mod P
x2= (S+2R) mod P

Now we can reconstruct S if we have both x1 and x2:
(2x1 - x2) mod P = S mod P = S

## Method to Split Keys

The secret is at x=0, y=S
1st share = x=1, y=S+R
2nd share = x=2, y=S+2R
3rd share = x=3, y=S+3R

Given any 2 points on a line, you can find S.
To require 3 keys, we will use a quadratic function.
| Equation | Random Parameters | Points required to recover S |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (S+RX) mod P | R | 2 |
| (S+ R1X + R2X^2) mod P | R1, R2 | 3 |
| (S+R1X + R2X^2 + R3X^3) mod P | R1, R2, R3 | 4 |

## Comments

Good: store shares separately, adversary must compromise several keys
We can afford to loose some keys
Bad: need to bring keys together to sign

## MULTISIG

It would be good if we can use the share keys to sign.
Multisig lets us keep the shares apart, and approve transactions without reconstructing key.

**Example**
Four founders A,B,C,D each generate a key-pair and put secret key in safe
Company's cold-stored coins use multi-sig so that 3 of the 4 keys must sign to release a coin.
