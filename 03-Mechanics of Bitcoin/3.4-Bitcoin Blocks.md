# 3.4 - Bitocin Blocks

Why bundle transactions together?

- single unit of work for miners
- limit length of hash-chain

Each block consists of:

- hash pointer to previous block
- hash pointer to Merkle tree of all transactions

## Bitcoin Blocks

There's one special transaction in the merkle tree, the coinbase transaction.
This is where bitcoins are created.

In practice, it's 25 + transaction fees.
The hash of this transaction is all 0's.
coinbase parameter is arbitrary
