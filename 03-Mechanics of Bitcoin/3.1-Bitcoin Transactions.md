# 3.1 - Bitcoin Transactions

## Recap

Bitcoin consensus gives us:

- append-only ledger - we can only write to it
- decentralized consensus
- miners to validate transactions

## Account based ledger

- can create coins
- then transfer coins between accounts (with signature)
  But down side to this system, is that we need to keep track of remaining balance for everyone.
  So, to determine if a transaction is valid, one has to look through the entire history.

## Transaction based ledger (Bitcoin)

Specify a number of input and outputs

Creation: input is 0, output is 25 to Alice

To transfer: input is reference to previous output (25)
Output is the new balance, Bob 17, Alice 8. The payment to self is called a `change address`
This is signed by Alice.

Subsequent transactions can refer back to previous transaction in the form of transaction#, output#

As a result, we can also merge values from different transaction# and output#.
Similarily for joint payments.

## Parts of Bitcoin Transaction

There are 3 parts:

1. Metadata
2. Inputs
3. Outputs

**Metadata**

- transaction hash
- housekeeping such as version number etc
- size of input and outputs
- locktime (more on this later)

**Inputs**
array of input with the same form:

- previous transaction's hash or hash pointer
- index of the transaction where we are claiming
- signature

**Outputs**

- value
- recipient address
- a script (more on this later)
