# 3.6 Limitations and Improvements

## Hard coded limits

- 10 min avg creation time per block
- 1M bytes in a block
- 21M total bitcoin maximum
- deminishing mining reward 50, 25, 12.5

- each block is limited to 1M bytes
- 250> bytes / transaction
- 7 transactions / second (1M bytes per 10minutes / 250 bytes/s)

Cryptographic limits in Bitcoin

- only 1 signature algorithm (ECDSA/P256)
- hard-coded hash functions
  likely broken by 2040

## Hard Forks

To make a change, this is called `hard-forking` change

- hard for nodes to upgrade to new software
- new nodes use new software and found a new block, but old nodes refuse to propagate

## Soft Forks

We can add new features which only limit the set of valid transactions.
New features are stricter than previous.
New nodes will enforce stricter rules, old nodes will approve.

Example: Pay-to-script hash
Other possibilities:

- new signature schemes
- extra per-block meta data

Possible hard forks:

- new op codes
- change to size limits
- change to mining rate
- many bug fixes (ie. multisig)
