# 1.2 - Hash Pointers and Data Structures

**Hash Pointer** - pointer to where some info is stored, and hash of the info
Tells us where it is, and what value it has
We can ask:

- get the info back
- verify that it hasn't changed

We can replace linked list using hash pointers. The result that we can detect tempering.
For example, if someone changed the previous block, the H() of that block will not match with our hash pointer.
He also won't be able to temper with the Head of the list.

We can also build a binary tree using hash pointers - merkle tree
The benefit of a merkle tree is that we can show data is part of a tree by just traversing from root to the node. O(log n) time to prove.

Sorted Merkle Tree - basically sorts the leaf nodes in some order
Can verify non-membership in O(log n), just need to find the members before and after to disprove.
