# 1.3 - Digital Signatures

## Goal

**We want to achieve the following:**

- Only you can sign, but anyone can verify
- Signature is tied to a particular document, cannot be copy-pasted to another document

## API For Digital Sigatures

sk = secret signing key
pk = public verification key

(sk, pk) := generateKeys(keysize)

sig := sign(sk, message)
isValid := verify(pk, message, sig)

Step1: Sign document/message and output a signature
Step2: Verify signature using pk, signature, message

## Practical Blockchain Application

- use hashed messages, limits message size
- sign the hash pointer, to provide more security. This signature basically signs the entire structure of the blockchain

Bitcoin uses ECDSA standard
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
